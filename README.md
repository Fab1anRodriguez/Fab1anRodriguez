I am a software development student at SENA, currently training in Software Analysis and Development. I obtained my software programming certification in 2023, and since then, I have been constantly improving my skills and working on personal and collaborative projects.

I am passionate about problem-solving, software architecture, and backend development. I enjoy tackling challenges that require logical thinking and optimization, and I am always looking for opportunities to learn new technologies and refine my coding practices.

Beyond technical skills, I value teamwork, clear communication, and adaptability. I believe that great software is built through collaboration, and I strive to contribute positively to any project I work on. I am also committed to continuous learning, keeping up with the latest industry trends, and expanding my expertise in databases and scalable systems.
